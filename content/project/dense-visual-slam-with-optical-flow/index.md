* Conducted research on dense stereo SLAM in dynamic surroundings with RTAB-MAP on the basis of Visual Odometry.
* Added Optical Flow to detect moving objects in frames and ruled them out when extracting feature points and mapping.
* Performed testing on embedded mapping and navigation algorithm on a robot car with Nvidia TX2.
