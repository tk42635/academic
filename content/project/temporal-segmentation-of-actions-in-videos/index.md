* Researched on weakly supervised learning of video action segmentation based on Hidden Markov Model with a polymorphic neural network to infer the emission probability of HMM.
* Incorporated spectral clustering of framesâ€™ feature vectors into HMM and decoded the HMM with Viterbi algorithm to acquire optimal action label distribution in a video frame sequence.
