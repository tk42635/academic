* Built a cross-platform front-end shopping app based on React Native and Expo and developed multiple modules including navigator, cart, and order page by using react-navigation, moment and other libraries.
* Listened, fetched and managed application states by using Redux to maintain a unidirectional data flow.
* Handled and validated user input successfully such as requests for adding new items to the shop as admin.
* Stored all the data at a remote Firebase database and sent HTTP requests to a related sever for fetching, adding, deleting and modifying data on the database through Web API.
