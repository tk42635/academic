* Developed a mobile touch game based on Unity, in which players can touch and swipe on the screen to create a path on the board to lead all balls to the destination. 
* Added Unity Analytics items to collect and analyze user data from each time play.
* Updated the game logical core loop with multiple iterations based on feedback from user testing.
* Integrated rewarding system and store system into the game so as to increase user stickiness.
